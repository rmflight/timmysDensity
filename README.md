# Tim Hortons Density

The idea of this project is to determine Tim Hortons locations in relation to census dissemination areas to determine those locations near populations and the distance from Tim Hortons locations.

This work is inspired by [this post](http://www.ifweassume.com/2012/10/the-united-states-of-starbucks.html).

Census data is from Statistics Canada, Tim Hortons locations from Foursquare. Read the [vignette](https://rmflight.github.io/timmysDensity) for more information.
