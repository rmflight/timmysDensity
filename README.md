# Tim Hortons Density

The idea of this project is to use census data and Google Maps data to figure out the density
of Tim Hortons locations in Canada based on Stats Canada census dissemination areas. This will
also allow us to combine the census data with the Tim's locations and figure out the average 
distance to a Tim Hortons location.

## Data

The dissemination areas location data was downloaded as a GML from Stats Canada
website. The census data is the CSV for dissemination areas (smallest census unit).
