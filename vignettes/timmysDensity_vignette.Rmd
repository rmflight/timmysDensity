# Tim Hortons Density

Inspired by this [post](), I wanted to examine the locations and density of Tim Hortons restaurants in Canada. Using Stats Canada data, each census tract is queried on Foursquare for Tims locations.

The actual Statistics Canada data at the dissemination block level can be downloaded from [here](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/ref/att-eng.cfm). The census dissemination block boundary file was downloaded from [here](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-2011-eng.cfm), choosing the `gml` format, for dissemination areas and the cartographic boundary files.
